/// Operations for encoding paths to and from base64 strings.
/// Paths are not strings, so should not be saved to a TEXT column in the sqlite database.
/// The TEXT data type can be UTF8 or UTF16, which paths are _not_.
/// However, I tried to save paths as the BLOB type, but it was just too painiful so now
/// paths are encoded as base64. This allows non-UTF8 and non-UTF16 paths to be saved to a
/// TEXT column in sqlite.
///
/// Note that each base 64 column will hav a b64 suffix and will
/// also have a '*_lossy' sibling with a non-base 64 encoded version of the path with
/// invalid non-UTF8 characters removed. The lossy sibling is for debugging only and
/// should not be read by Fotema.
///
/// Also note that Fotema computes some relative paths, such as for thumbnails, and these
/// _won't_ be base 64 encoded as we can be sure to only use UTF8 characters in the paths.
